# Asylum-seekers

This analysis is about the data showing where refugees are coming from by the year and  where they are seeking for asylum.
This data contains growing number of asylum seekers by year to year from 1999 to 2016. I took this data from Kaggle and used Tableau to depict the picture of their country of origin and their destination country by year.
